    This thesis investigates the simulation and application of optical flats, essential in precision measurement science. It begins by detailing the challenges in simulating optical flats using ray-tracing in C++ and progresses to a successful Python-based approach that accurately models light interactions through intersecting planes. Results highlight that while ray-tracing effectively illustrates material and surface interactions, wavefront simulations provide clearer insights into light propagation and interference. The study confirms the utility of Python simulations in educational and research contexts, demonstrating their effectiveness in analyzing optical flat measurements. This work enhances the understanding of optical flats' properties and improves their practical applications.
