    \chapter{Abstract}
    This bachelor thesis examines the 3D surface reconstruction from optical flat measurements. The goal of this research is to make a program that takes as input a photo with an optical flat measurement on it and then approximates the 3D surface using the interference fringes displayed on the photo.
