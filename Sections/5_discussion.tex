\chapter{Discussion}
%This method of using planes separated by specific intervals corresponding to the light wavelength proved effective in simulating the necessary conditions to study optical flats. The Python environment, complemented by a user-friendly GUI, enhanced the flexibility and accessibility of the simulation, making it a robust tool for both educational and research applications in optical measurements.
