Title = {Revisiting Newton's rings with a plasmonic optical flat for
   high-accuracy surface inspection},
Journal = {LIGHT-SCIENCE \& APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Two parallel optical surfaces often exhibit colorful fringes along the
   lines of equal thickness because of the interference of light. This
   simple phenomenon allows one to observe subwavelength corrugations on a
   reflective surface by simply placing on it a flat reference dielectric
   surface, a so-called optical flat, and inspecting the resultant
   interference pattern. In this work, we extend this principle from
   dielectric surfaces to two-dimensional plasmonic nanostructures. Optical
   couplings between an Au nanodisk array and an Au thin film were measured
   quantitatively using two different techniques, namely, the classical
   Newton's rings method and a closed-loop nano-positioning system.
   Extremely high spectral sensitivity to the inter-surface distance was
   observed in the near-field coupling regime, where a 1-nm change in
   distance could alter the resonance wavelength by almost 10 nm, 440 times
   greater than the variation in the case without near-field coupling. With
   the help of a numerical fitting technique, the resonance wavelength
   could be determined with a precision of 0.03 nm, corresponding to a
   distance precision as high as 0.003 nm. Utilizing this effect, we
   demonstrated that a plasmonic nanodisk array can be utilized as a
   plasmonic optical flat, with which nanometer-deep grooves can be
   directly visualized using a low-cost microscope.},

Abstract = {Phase Measuring Deflectometry (PMD) is a non-contact, high dynamic-range
   and full-field metrology which becomes a serious competitor to
   interferometry. However, the accuracy of deflectometry metrology is
   strongly influenced by the level of the calibrations, including test
   geometry, imaging pin-hole camera and digital display. In this paper, we
   propose a novel method that can measure optical flat surface figure to a
   high accuracy. We first calibrate the camera using a checker pattern
   shown on a LCD display at six different orientations, and the last
   orientation is aligned at the same position as the test optical flat. By
   using this method, lens distortions and the mapping relationship between
   the CCD pixels and the subaperture coordinates on the test optical flat
   can be determined at the same time. To further reduce the influence of
   the calibration errors on measurements, a reference optical flat with a
   high quality surface is measured, and then the system errors in our PMD
   setup can be eliminated by subtracting the figure of the reference flat
   from the figure of the test flat. Although any expensive coordinates
   measuring machine, such as laser tracker and coordinates measuring
   machine are not applied in our measurement, our experimental results of
   optical flat figure from low to high order aberrations still show a good
   agreement with that from the Fizeau interferometer. (C) 2016 Elsevier

abstract = {This section introducses basics of the “fringe analysis”, which is one of the major methods for digitizing various physical phenomena. It investigates the principles and basic procedures and some of their applications in the fringe analysis with a computer. The section describes a distinctive process of converting a wrapped phase map to the final physical distribution, namely, “phase unwrapping”. In the early period of the computer’s introduction, an image processing technique for contour-like fringes, including extractions of the fringe centers and their order number evaluations, was mainstream in the fringe analysis where the sub-fringe order was estimated through the interpolation between fringe centers. More sophisticated analysis principles were evolved after the 1970s; they are, namely, the sub-fringe phase analysis represented by the fringe scanning method, the phase-shifting method, and the Fourier transformation method. The section show an actual process of the fringe analysis for profilometry using the deformed grating method with an interference fringe projection.}
